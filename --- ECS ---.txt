--- ECS ---


/*******
IN UNITY
*******/
Entities maintained in EntityManager 
	Entities have array of Components
	Entity archetype creates entity with certain combination of components

	Components are data on entites

	Systems are logic that change the components


EntityArchetypes -> arrayList we can add to with Entity objects

in general : Entity relies on Component relies on System

ECS takes place in model of MVC

ECS as a relationnal database?
	Entities are primary keys -> Components are the tables -> Systems are the queries

Component - Property with object data
Entity - Container for properties
System - Data processing logic
EntityManager - Entity database
SystemManager - Container for systems

ECS uses composition over inheritance
